Player is a mage casting spells to heal people.

People can be:
Burned, Frozen, Electrified, or Stinky

These ailments are cured by:
Water, Fire, Earth, and Air

See how many people you can make happy.

Some people are extra inflicted, causing them to have two or more symptoms.

Deal with the symptoms in the order they are listed.

ie. "Stinky, Burned, Farmer" ~> "Air, Water"

Sometimes, monsters will sneak in.

You can tell if a monster is around because its conditions will be misspelled.

If a monster appears, use your attacks to defeat it! Hit it with the number of symptoms it is pretending to have!
